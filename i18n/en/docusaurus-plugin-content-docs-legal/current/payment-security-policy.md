# Payment Usage and Security Policy

This policy outlines the procedures and measures we implement to ensure the security of payment transactions conducted through our platform.

## Payment Systems Used

We use trusted third-party payment service providers to process transactions securely with encryption. Currently, we support several payment methods, including but not limited to:

- Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, MasterCard)
- Bank Transfers
- Virtual Bank Accounts
- QRIS Payments
- Third-party platforms such as PayPal

## Payment Information Security

To protect your financial data, we use industry-standard encryption protocols (such as SSL/TLS) when processing and transmitting payment information. We do not store credit card information directly on our servers.

All payment information submitted through our platform is processed directly by certified payment providers compliant with industry security standards (such as PCI-DSS).

## Fraud Prevention

We employ automated systems to detect suspicious transactions. If fraudulent activity is suspected, the transaction may be placed on hold for further verification. We may contact you through our official email for clarification or additional actions.

## Failed Transactions

If a transaction fails, please ensure that:

- Your internet connection is stable
- Payment information entered is correct
- There are sufficient funds in the selected payment method

If the issue persists, please contact us through the [Contact Us](/hubungi-kami) page or email us at [support@nihonbuzz.org](mailto:support@nihonbuzz.org).

## Refunds

Refund policies are governed by our [Refund and Return Policy](/legal/refund-return-policy). Users are entitled to request a refund if they meet the eligibility and follow the specified procedures.

## Policy Updates

We may update this policy from time to time to comply with legal regulations or adapt to technological changes. The latest version will always be available on this page.
