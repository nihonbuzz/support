# Typography

Typography plays a key role in maintaining visual consistency and a professional look for the Nihonbuzz brand. We use a specific combination of fonts to build a strong and recognizable identity.

## Primary Fonts

### Staatliches

Our main heading font is **Staatliches**. It features bold, geometric shapesâ€”perfect for titles and elements that need to stand out.

> Usage example:

<div style={{ fontFamily: '"Staatliches", sans-serif', fontSize: '2rem', lineHeight: '2.8rem', margin: '0.5rem 0' }}>
  Nihonbuzz Academy
</div>

### Inter (or system sans-serif)

For body text and general navigation, we use **Inter** or other system sans-serif fonts. This provides a clean, modern, and highly readable look across screen sizes.

> Usage example:

<div style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.5rem', margin: '0.5rem 0' }}>
  ```
  Learn Japanese in a fun and structured way with Nihonbuzz Academy.
  ```
</div>

## Usage Guidelines

- Use **Staatliches** only for headings or key brand elements.
- Use **Inter** or other sans-serif fonts for body text, descriptions, and UI navigation.
- Avoid mixing more than two font types on a single page or component.
- Avoid using all-caps excessively, except for main headings.

## Font Access

- **Staatliches** is available on Google Fonts: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Staatliches](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Staatliches)
- **Inter** is available on Google Fonts: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)

Be sure to load these fonts via `@import` or directly integrate them into your frontend project if you are not using system fonts.
