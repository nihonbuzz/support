# Nihonbuzz Iconography

Icons are an essential part of Nihonbuzz's visual communication. Our iconography is designed to deliver messages clearly, intuitively, and consistently across all platforms.

## Icon Style

We use a **minimalistic, solid, and highly recognizable** icon style. Each icon is created as a vector to ensure scalability without losing quality.

### Key Characteristics

- **Simple, bold shapes**
- **Rounded corners** for a friendly look
- **Consistent stroke thickness** across all icons
- **Monochromatic color scheme** (typically black or white) for flexibility

## Example Icons

Here are a few official icon samples:

<div class="preview-wrapper" style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/Site-Icon/Nihonbuzz-Logo-Icon-512.png" alt="App Icon" width="64" />
  <img src="/assets/Site-Icon/Nihonbuzz-Logo-Icon-1024-Circle.png" alt="Circle Icon" width="64" />
  <img src="/assets/Site-Icon/BIMI/nihonbuzz-tiny.svg" alt="BIMI SVG Icon" width="64" />
</div>

> Additional icons can be found in the directory: `static/assets/Site-Icon/`

## Sizes & Formats

- Primary formats: `.svg` (vector), `.png`, `.ico`
- Common sizes: 512×512 px, 1024×1024 px
- Favicon also available in `.ico` format for web use

## Usage Guidelines

- Always use the official icons provided. Do not alter shapes or create unauthorized variations.
- Prefer **SVG** format for the best results on high-resolution displays.
- Maintain adequate spacing around icons to ensure clarity.
- Avoid using colors that reduce contrast and legibility.
