# Nihonbuzz Visual Patterns

Visual patterns are decorative elements used to aesthetically reinforce Nihonbuzz's brand identity. These patterns can be applied as backgrounds, negative space fillers, or additional design elements across various media.

## Pattern Philosophy

Our patterns are designed based on the following principles:

- **Order and rhythm**, reflecting structure and professionalism.
- **Geometric simplicity**, aligned with the brand’s minimalist style.
- **Flexibility**, allowing application across various sizes and media.

## Pattern Examples

Here are examples of Nihonbuzz's primary patterns:

<div class="preview-wrapper" style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/Pattern/pattern.png" alt="Pattern PNG Example" width="200" />
  <img src="/assets/Pattern/pattern.svg" alt="Pattern SVG Example" width="200" />
</div>

> Vector format is recommended for print and high-resolution use.

## File Formats

Patterns are available in the following formats:

- `.svg` – for maximum flexibility (web and print design)
- `.png` – for previews and digital media
- `.eps` – for professional print applications
