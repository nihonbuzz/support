# Nihonbuzz Logo

The logo is the most essential element of Nihonbuzz's visual identity. We have two primary identities: **Nihonbuzz** as the corporate entity, and **Nihonbuzz Academy** as the educational division.

## Nihonbuzz Logo (Company)

Use this logo to represent the corporate brand, including business communications, partnerships, and corporate media.
