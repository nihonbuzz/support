# Nihonbuzz Logo

The logo is the most essential element of Nihonbuzz's visual identity. We have two primary identities: **Nihonbuzz** as the corporate entity, and **Nihonbuzz Academy** as the educational division.

## Nihonbuzz Academy Logo

Use the Academy logo in educational contexts such as courses, training materials, and learning events.
