## ðŸ§­ Learning Flow in a Course

Each course is divided into several units, usually in this order:

1. **Introduction**  
   Explains the goals, benefits, and scope of the course.

2. **Learning Modules**  
   The main content, organized into chapters or small topics. Includes videos, reading materials, and quizzes.

3. **Assignments / Practice**  
   Hands-on tasks to reinforce learning. In some courses, you need to complete these before moving to the next section.

4. **Final Quiz / Test**  
   Evaluate your understanding of the material. Passing scores may be required for course completion.

5. **Certificate**  
   A digital certificate is issued once you complete 100% of the course and pass the final test (if applicable).
