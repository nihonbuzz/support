## ✅ Steps to Complete a Course

To officially complete a course, make sure you:

1. **Watch all videos and read all materials**  
   Some courses only count as completed if every content item is marked as viewed.

2. **Complete quizzes or exercises in each module**  
   Some courses require you to pass these before moving to the next section.

3. **Submit the final assignment (if required)**  
   This may be a project, essay, or practical task that your instructor reviews.

4. **Take the final test (if available)**  
   Certain courses include a final exam as part of the completion requirements.
