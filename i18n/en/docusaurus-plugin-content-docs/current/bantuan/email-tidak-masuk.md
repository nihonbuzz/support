# Email Not Received (Reset / Activation)

After registering or requesting a password reset on Nihonbuzz Academy, you should receive important emails such as:

- Account activation email
- Password reset link
- Purchase or course registration notifications

However, in some cases, these emails may not appear in your inbox. Here’s how to troubleshoot this issue.

## 📬 Check Spam or Promotions Folder

Our system emails may sometimes be filtered automatically by your email provider and placed in:

- **Spam** folder
- **Promotions** tab (Gmail)
- **Updates / Social** tabs

👉 **Solution:**  
Check all these folders and mark our emails as **Not Spam** so future emails go to your main inbox.

---

## 📛 Incorrect Email Address

A typo in your email address during registration or password reset will prevent the system from sending emails to you.

👉 **Solution:**  
Repeat the process with the correct email address. If unsure, contact support for assistance.

## ⏳ Email Server Delay

Email delivery can occasionally be delayed by 5–10 minutes, especially during high traffic periods.

👉 **Solution:**  
Wait a few minutes and check your inbox again.

## 📵 Email Blocked by Provider

Some email providers may block system emails, particularly if you are using a company email or custom domain.

👉 **Solution:**
- Use a common email provider like Gmail or Yahoo
- Or, whitelist our sender address in your contacts
