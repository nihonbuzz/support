## 🧪 About Quizzes

Quizzes appear in some modules, either as short exercises or final tests. Common types of quizzes include:

- **Multiple choice**
- **True / False**

Each quiz can have specific rules set by the instructor, such as the number of attempts (e.g., 1 time, 3 times, or unlimited) and time limits.

## 📊 Grading

Here are a few important things about grading:

- **Passing score** is usually set per course, for example 70%.
- **Final score** may be calculated from multiple quizzes and assignments.

After submitting a quiz, your result will appear instantly and be stored in the system.
